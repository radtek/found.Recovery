# found.Recovery
_Small and powerful program to recover *.chk files from found000.  Program recognize few hundred file types._

**I just had huge problem. Lost my SSD (when it's not even reported any SMART warnings/errors). I had a copy, but everything from 2 productive weeks was lost. After some work and dd magic I had recovered some data. But Windows screwed everything by "recovering" them to found000. Every tool that I found, was very limited. They recovered only 20-40 file types. Thats close to nothing. 
So... I've created my own. It can recover over 200 filetypes (for now) and most of my work was saved.
Now I'm sharing my tool with you.**
